        <h2>A Citadel of Orthodoxy</h2>
        <p>Walking the grounds of Princeton Seminary in 1890 was a vastly different experience than walking them today. The air was thick with the scent of coal smoke, old vellum, and the rigorous intellectual intensity of the "Old School" Presbyterian tradition. Under the leadership of Warfield and his predecessors, Princeton was not merely a school; it was a fortress defending the historic Christian faith against the rising "Higher Criticism" from Europe.</p>
        
        <p>Students were expected to be masters of the biblical languages. It was common to hear Greek and Hebrew discussed with the same fluency as English in the refectory. The education was encyclopedic, covering the full scope of historical, systematic, and polemic theology. Warfield believed that a minister should be the most educated man in the room, capable of answering the biologist, the historian, and the philosopher with equal precision.</p>

        <div class="pull-quote">
            "Princeton is a place where the students are taught to think, and to think in the presence of God."

        <h2>The Giants: Warfield’s Coworkers</h2>
        <p>Warfield did not stand alone. He was surrounded by a faculty often referred to as a "constellation of scholarship." Here are the men who sat at the high table with him:</p>

        <div class="faculty-grid">
            <div class="profile-card">
                <h3>Archibald Alexander Hodge</h3>
                <p><strong>The Predecessor:</strong> Before Warfield took the chair of Didactic Theology, it belonged to A.A. Hodge. He was the man who co-authored the famous 1881 article on Inspiration with Warfield. Hodge provided the warmth and pastoral spirit that balanced Warfield’s clinical precision.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="profile-card">
                <h3>Geerhardus Vos</h3>
                <p><strong>The Father of Biblical Theology:</strong> Perhaps Warfield’s most brilliant contemporary. While Warfield focused on <em>Systematic</em> theology (the logic of faith), Vos focused on <em>Biblical</em> theology (the history of revelation). Together, they made Princeton the global center for Reformed thought.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="profile-card">
                <h3>Robert Dick Wilson</h3>
                <p><strong>The Linguistic Master:</strong> If a critic claimed a verse in Daniel was a later forgery, Robert Dick Wilson was the man who would learn 45 different ancient languages just to prove the critic wrong. He provided the philological "teeth" to Warfield’s defense of the Bible.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="profile-card">
                <h3>J. Gresham Machen</h3>
                <p><strong>The Protégé:</strong> In the final years of Warfield’s life, a young Machen was rising to prominence. He saw Warfield as his hero and mentor. After Warfield's death in 1921, Machen took up the mantle to fight the fundamentalist-modernist controversy.</p>

        <h2>The Daily Grind: Lectures and Life</h2>
        <p>A typical day for B.B. Warfield began early. Despite his massive literary output, he was first and foremost a teacher. His lectures in Miller Chapel were known for their overwhelming depth. He rarely used notes for the sake of reading; he spoke from a mind that had seemingly memorized the entire Westminster Confession and the works of Calvin.</p>
        
        <p>However, the tragedy of Princeton was its isolation. As the world outside moved toward secularism, the "Princeton circle" became tighter. Warfield and his colleagues were aware that they were "the last of the Romans." They saw themselves as holding the line for a future generation. This created a unique bond among the faculty—they were not just coworkers; they were comrades in a spiritual war.</p>

        <h2>The Conflict Within</h2>
        <p>It wasn't all harmony. The faculty often debated the finer points of "Theistic Evolution" and the "Common Sense Realism" philosophy that grounded their work. Warfield was often the most "progressive" of the conservatives, open to scientific discovery while remaining immovable on the authority of the Word. His coworkers often looked to him to settle the most difficult intellectual disputes of the era.</p>
