        <p><span class="dropcap">B</span>enjamin Breckinridge Warfield (1851–1921) is widely considered the last of the great "Princeton Theologians." For thirty-four years he was a bulwark of Reformed orthodoxy against the rising tides of modernism and theological liberalism in the United States.</p>

        <h2>Early Life & Education</h2>
        <p>Born into a Kentucky family with a strong preaching heritage, Warfield graduated from Princeton University in 1871 with honors in mathematics and science. He later studied in Leipzig and Princeton Seminary before entering the Presbyterian ministry.</p>

        <h2>Career & Contributions</h2>
        <p>Warfield succeeded A. A. Hodge in the Chair of Didactic and Polemic Theology at Princeton Seminary and published widely on biblical inspiration, Christology, and the work of the Holy Spirit. His scientific background shaped his methodical approach to theology.</p>

        <h2>Personal Life</h2>
        <p>In 1876 Warfield married Annie, who became chronically ill early in their marriage. He cared for her devotedly for decades, rarely traveling from Princeton so he could attend to her needs while continuing his scholarly work.</p>

        <h2>Legacy</h2>
        <p>Warfield's work on inerrancy, his defenses of orthodox doctrines, and his numerous essays and book reviews continue to influence Reformed theology. His collected works and correspondence are important primary sources for historians of American religion.</p>
