        <p><span class="dropcap">B</span>enjamin Breckinridge Warfield (1851–1921) is widely considered the last of the great "Princeton Theologians." For thirty-four years, he stood as a bulwark of Reformed orthodoxy against the rising tides of modernism and theological liberalism in the United States.</p>
        
        <h2>Early Influences</h2>
        <p>Born into a wealthy Kentucky family, Warfield was the grandson of the famous preacher Robert Jefferson Breckinridge. His early education was surprisingly scientific; he was an avid collector of birds and an expert in shorthorn cattle breeding. This scientific rigor never left him—he approached theology not as a mystic, but as a systematician who believed that truth was objective and discoverable.</p>

        <h2>Theological Contributions</h2>
        <p>Warfield is most famous for his defense of the <strong>Inerrancy of Scripture</strong>. He argued that the Bible was "concursively" produced—meaning God used the distinct personalities and styles of human authors to produce a text that was, in its original autographs, entirely free from error.</p>
        
        <div class="highlight-box">
            "The Bible is the Word of God in such a sense that whatever it says, God says." — B.B. Warfield
        </div>

        <p>Beyond inerrancy, Warfield was a champion of "Old School" Presbyterianism. He wrote extensively on the work of the Holy Spirit, the divinity of Christ, and the Plan of Salvation. Interestingly, he was also open to a form of "Theistic Evolution," believing that God could have used natural processes to bring about the human body, provided that the soul was a direct divine creation.</p>

            <h2>The Secret Burden</h2>
            <p>While Warfield was known as a fierce "lion" in print, his private life was defined by extreme tenderness. In 1876, while on their honeymoon in Germany, he and his wife Annie were caught in a violent thunderstorm. Annie suffered a trauma (likely a stroke or nervous system collapse) that left her an invalid for the rest of her life.</p>
            <p>For the next 39 years, Warfield rarely left her side. He did not travel to conferences or take vacations; he did his world-class research in a study just rooms away from his wife so he could care for her every need. This devotion adds a layer of deep empathy to his otherwise rigorous intellectual work.</p>

        <h2>Continue the Study</h2>
        <p>Warfield's bibliography consists of over 700 items, including books, articles, and reviews. His work continues to influence modern evangelicalism and Reformed theology worldwide.</p>
